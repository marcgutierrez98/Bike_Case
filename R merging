Although cleaning the done in Google Sheets, R Studio was used in order to load and merge the data.
Doing this allowed me to merge mutiple files into one singular file that was then used for visualization in Tableau.

First I load up the data into R
jan_2022 <- read.csv("Cyclistic Trip Data January 2022.csv")
feb_2022 <- read.csv("Cyclistic Trip Data February 2022.csv")
mar_2022 <- read.csv("Cyclistic Trip Data March 2022.csv")

I use bind_rows in order to merge the datasets into one complete dataset
q1_2022 <- bind_rows(jan_2022, feb_2022, mar_2022)
